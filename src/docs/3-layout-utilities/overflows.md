Sometimes you have more content than can fit in a particular region of your layout.

## X and/or Y overflows

* `overflow-x`
    
Use `overflow-x` when you may need a sideways scroll. (`overflow-x` shows horizontal scroll but not vertical scroll.) E.g. when you have an [oversized table]({{ '/docs/6-simple-components/tables#oversized-tables' | url }}). Or, you may have a simply sideways-scrolling gallery.

* `overflow-y`

Use `overflow-y` when you have content that is too tall for its wrapper. (`overflow-y` shows vertical scroll but not horizontal scroll.) E.g. see [AlpineJS modal with scrollable content]({{ '/docs/7-alpinejs-components/modal#styling-modal-panels' | url }}).

* `overflow-xy`

Use `overflow-xy` when you have both width and height constraints but you want to show both horizontal and vertical scroll. This utility may be useful if you want to show a large map or [oversized table]({{ '/docs/6-simple-components/tables#oversized-tables' | url }}).

## Overflow hidden

* `overflow-hidden`
    
Use `overflow-hidden` when you have too much content for displaying in a block element that has a constrained width and/or height, but you donâ€™t want to show either horizontal or vertical scroll.
